TODO:

Low priority:
Allow user to use their opponent's ruleset
Save each ruleset in a different file "rules/" directory?
Starter decks
Side deck format and ruleset customisability
Do something with HandManager (move hand functions there from CardFight)
Sometimes extra cards drawn at the start of the round (high ping?)
Spectating / Replays
