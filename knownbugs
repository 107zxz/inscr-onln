TODO:
Change "Sacrificial Substitute" to "Noble Sacrifice"
Fix new lobbies on windows when space in path
Spectating

Low priority:
Allow user to use their opponent's ruleset
Save each ruleset in a different file "rules/" directory?
Starter decks
Side deck format and ruleset customisability
Do something with HandManager (move hand functions there from CardFight)
Sometimes extra cards drawn at the start of the round (high ping?)
