    * Double death can have its effect changed to only double bones through the "necro_boned" property (temporary)
* Bug Fixes
    * Summoning the moon to fight the moon will no longer bug the game
    * Your hand will now look less strange when holding a large number of cards
    * Having multiple cards with reconstitute dead at the same time will no longer result in the loss of those cards
