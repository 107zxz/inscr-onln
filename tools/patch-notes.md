v0.2.2 is out!

Theme editor improvements, tunnel error messages, and a feature you didn't ask for, but deserve

* Theme editor now features colour pickers, and appears in the corner now
    * This means you can open the deck editor with the theme editor open to see all the cards!


* Error messages will now appear when the tunnel fails to connect, rather than hanging forever


* You can now specify a port for IP connections (you can use this to connect to localhost.run games (syntax: xxxxx.lhrtunnel.life:80)
