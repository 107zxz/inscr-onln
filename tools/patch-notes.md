* Balance Changes (IMF Competitive v0.0.12)
    * Ouroboros
        * Is now hammerable again
        * Unkillable => Reconstitute
        * Ouroboros has either been game breaking, unplayable, or both. Hopefully this works
    * Flying Ant
        * Health 2 => 1
        * With 2 hp, Flying Ant had the same stats as Sparrow, even without another ant on the board
    * Insectodrone
        * Health 1 => 2
        * This is to make it worth its 3 energy cost
    * L33pB0t
        * Attack 0 => 1
        * Energy Cost 1 => 3
        * This is to buff factory conduit, and make L33pB0t more like Bullfrog
    * The Moon
        * The moon will now strike all opposing spaces regardless of if they have a card in them.
* New Features
    * The Battle UI has been reworked (see screenshot)
* Bug Fixes
    * Sacrifice markers can no longer be created when not summoning a card
    * Replays will no longer attempt to use invalid characters in their filenames (and will now save on windows)
    * The moon will now correctly interact with burrower when attacking
    * Reconstitute can now track multiple cards at once
