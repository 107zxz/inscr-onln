Source code is available under the GPL license for anyone to use.

Source was formerly available under MIT license, but this led to forks being distributed over discord as executables without visible source code, and I really don't want this project to be yet another discord virus factory. I also want this game's code to be a resource for people who want to make their own fangames (even though it is super spaghetti).
